The goal of this project is to simplify the model making process, while allowing for dynamic LODs.
The method used is that a mesh is made up of a set of "slices".
Those "slices" are a collection of BÃ©zier curves.
Those "slices" are then connected in a specified manner to form the mesh.

This is VERY work in progress
